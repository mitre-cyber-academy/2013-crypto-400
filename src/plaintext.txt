To Sherlock Holmes she 1s always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her
under 4ny other n4me. In his eyes she eclipses 4nd predomin4tes the whole of
her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All
emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and
observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed
himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a
gibe and a sneer. The flag is MCA-4445532E. They were admirable things for
the observer--excellent for draw1ng the ve1l from men's mot1ves and act1ons.
But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and
finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
throw a doubt upon all his m3ntal r3sults. Grit in a s3nsitiv3 instrum3nt, or a
crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a
strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him,
and that w0man was the late Irene Adler, 0f dubi0us and questi0nable mem0ry.
